    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Music has been a lifelong excitement. Here's some highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rockband: As a teenager I wrote my own songs and played concerts with my rockbands.</li>
        <li>Partyband: After high school I formed a Disney tribute band with some friends. We have entertained with nostalgic and catchy tunes at countless parties awakening the inner child of many.</li>
        <li>Choir: At university I was trained conducting choirs and have since conducted many amateur choirs.</li>
        <li>Musical: Hanging out with both music and theatre students I developed an interest in musical theatre and started writing and performing original musical shows together with fellow students. I wanna create more musicals and right now I'm attending musical shows and listening to a lot of musicals to learn from the best.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal Development</h2>
    <p>In 2017 I went through some challenging experiences that made me reflect on my way of being in this world and started a new interest in personal development.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personality Types: While struggling writing my master thesis I was introduced to Myers Briggs. It blew my mind and a lot of struggles made sense.</li>
        <li>Coaching: I completed a coaching course to become a better high school teacher. I likes it so much that I quit my job to do it full time.</li>
        <li>Speaking: I went through a public speaking training to share my story. I wanna inspire people to listen to the heart and do what it takes to create a life of joy.</li>
        <li>Ideas: I listen to a lot of audiobooks and podcasts to feed myself new ideas on broadening my perspective.</li>
        <li>Systems: I have a very conceptual mind and enjoy systems that describes aspects of human life - especially typologies like Myers Briggs, the Enneagram, Love Languages and Attachment Styles. Ego work and relational practises also have my interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Art Festivals</h2>
    <p>I love magical experiences with kind people in extravagent invironments. Since 2018 I have been part of the Scandinavian Burning Man community co-creating big and small events with spectacular content.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Costume Tent: A tent full of outfits and glitter for everyone to dress up as fancy and sparkly they like.</li>
        <li>Kitchen: Taking lead on food plans and shopping.</li>
        <li>Performance: Performing at cabarets and no-talent shows with my music comedy group The Meows.</li>
        <li>Candy Clouds: A soft and sweet space full of pillows and candy.</li>
    </ul>
